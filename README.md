# ptrs

ptrs (**p**enetration **t**est **r**eport **s**chema) is a schema for structured penetration test
reports.

## Why?

### Receiving a penetration test report

Ever received the results of a penetration test as a PDF and were then tasked with transferring
the findings into your company's ticketing system?

Not only is that tedious and boring but also error prone and time consuming.
With ptrs-formattted reports you can easily script the task once and then reuse your script
every time you receive a report.

### Generating a penetration test report

Suggest ptrs to your customers - they will love you for it!

Also, using a structured file format you can focus on the content of the report without worrying
about formatting.

Still want a PDF report as well? You can create a template in a markup language like AsciiDoc
and convert it to PDF (see below).
