title: Overly permissive externally_connectable property
severity: Low
description: >
  The manifest file contains the externally_connectable property with several wildcard domains.
risk: >
  An attacker can read extension data if they find an exploitable XSS vulnerability or are able
  to take over a subdomain that matches the wildcard domains.
affected:
  - file: manifest.json
    code: >
      [...]
          "externally_connectable": {
              "matches": [
                  "https://*.acme.com/*",
                  "https://*.acme.local/*",
                  "https://*.acme.xyz/*"
              ]
          },
      [...]
reproduction:
  poc: >
    await chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
        "xyz", {
        "payload": "[...]",
    }, console.log)
  description: The PoC shows how to leak user data from the specified domain.
mitigation: >
  The externally_connectable property should only contain the domain that is needed.
