    title: Overly permissive externally_connectable property
    severity: Low
    description: >
      The manifest file contains the externally_connectable property with several wildcard domains.
    risk: >
      An attacker can read extension data if they find an exploitable XSS vulnerability or are able
      to take over a subdomain that matches the wildcard domains.
    affected:
      - file: manifest.json
        code: >
          [...]
              "externally_connectable": {
                  "matches": [
                      "https://*.acme.com/*",
                      "https://*.acme.local/*",
                      "https://*.acme.xyz/*"
                  ]
              },

            "xyz", {
            "payload": "[...]",
        }, console.log)
      description: The PoC shows how to leak user data from the specified domain.
    mitigation: >
      The externally_connectable property should only contain the domain that is needed.

    title: Invocation of autofill inside iframe
    severity: Medium
    description: >
      The autofill feature of the Android app can be used inside cross-origin iframes.
      The hostname of the top-level page is being used to determine the suggested
      credentials instead of the hostname of the iframe that initiated the autofill request.
    risk: >
      A user can be tricked into auto-filling their credentials in the context of a malicious page.
    reproduction:
      steps:
        - Install the Acme Android app and log in.
        - Add random credentials to the https://acme-test.tiiny.site website.
        - Visit https://acme-test.tiiny.site/ and select the password input field.
        - Select the credential that will be displayed.
        - An alert is being displayed which contains the email address and password.
    mitigation: >
      Prevent the user from auto-filling their credentials in iframes.

    title: Arbitrary connections in IFrameFactory
    severity: Medium
    description: >
      The connection variable can be changed to an arbitrary URL by running a crafted JavaScript
      on a page controlled by the attacker.
    risk: >
      The victim's autofill data can be read by the attacker.

    mitigation: >
      Directly pass the connection variable from the connection pool service.
